#### What Are the Indicators of Inclusive Prosperity?
Through a 15 year study of over 3,500 US neighhborhoods, researchers have identified 8 indicators that differentiate neighborhoods that are most likely to experience large decreases in poverty rates and no community distplacement from other neighborhoods in concentrated poverty. By applying these findings, we can help community leaders assess need and identify interventions that will maximize the impact of their resources.
